# 🛡️ Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a machine learning-based system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the popular Credit Card Fraud Dataset.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Fraud detection is a key challenge in financial systems. This project:
- Preprocesses highly imbalanced data
- Applies advanced machine learning models
- Evaluates performance using appropriate metrics
- Provides a CLI-based testing interface


## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which contains anonymized features and is highly imbalanced.


## 🧪 Key Features

- 🔁 Handled imbalanced data using **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- 🤖 Trained **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** models
- 📈 Evaluated using **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**
- 🧑‍💻 Simple **command-line interface** for testing the model
